Site Reviews is a WordPress plugin which allows you to easily receive and display reviews for your website and business.

== Description ==

Site Reviews is a plugin that allows your visitors to submit site reviews with a 1-5 star rating on your website, similar to the way you would on TripAdvisor or Yelp, and then allows you to display them using a widget or shortcode.

You can pin your best reviews so that they are always shown first, require approval before new review submissions are published, require visitors to be logged-in in order to write a review, send custom notifications on a new submission, and more. The plugin provides both widgets and shortcodes along with full shortcode documentation.

Add-ons are being developed to support syncing your TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews in order to display them locally on your website, as well as Post/Page/CPT/Comment ratings/reviews.

The plugin [roadmap](https://github.com/geminilabs/site-reviews/blob/develop/ROADMAP.md) includes tentative upcoming features.
