= Performance and Security =

Smart caching with server task allows to deliver content blazingly fast without long page loading. It's especially crucial when many feeds are pulled or you have big traffic. It's great to use this plugin for streaming your and any public Instagram content!

Plugin doesn't expose your private details (like tokens, app IDs and app secrets) to browser so we provide 100% security for any sensitive data.

= How it works =

You create streams in Grace Instagram Feed admin and copy generated shortcodes. Then you insert these shortcodes in any block on any page of your site. When Instagram feed is shown first time, it's got cached (takes more time for initial caching but then it will show blazingly fast) and rest of visitors see this cache for cache lifetime. So for example if you have set 20 min cache and 10000 users visit your site within these 20 min, it's **only one time** plugin will request API to pull data, for the rest of time users will see cached data almost instantly. Considering that server runs cache renew task in background it guarantees plugin's amazing performance.
