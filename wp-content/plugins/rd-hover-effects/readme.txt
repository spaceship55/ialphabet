== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can i resize images with RD Hover Effects? =
You can Find The Option Image Height & Width In setting Panel, Just use this Slider to resize image.
Also you should set images height and Width For 768 Responsive Option, you also get this option in Setting Panel.

= Why Hover Items Images being stretched? =

It’s important to maintain image Ratio, i understand.
You know there is limited space in hover effects. So you should use 430×255 pixel image if you are using 3 items in 1 row.

Example: If you use 800px height image with 1000px width just think this big image how can perfectly place images in 430×255 space place.

So i recommend you please use 430×255 pixel to get batter image ratio.
Let me know if you need anything, i will be happy to assist you.

= Where can I find documentation? =
Our Text can be found at http://codecans.com/tutorials/rd-hover-effects/documentation/
Our Video Tutorial Found Here: https://youtu.be/thSDFS9_mLE

= The plugin doesn't work, why? =
First, check your version of WordPress: the plugin is not supposed to work on old versions anymore. Make sure also to upgrade to the last version of the plugin.

Then try to deactivate and re-activate it, some user have reported that this fixes the problem.

Pay also attention to the new "Roles allowed to copy" option: it should convert the former "user level" option to the new standard, but unknown problems may arise. Make sure that your role is enabled.

If not, maybe there is some kind of conflict with other plugins: feel free to write me and we'll try to discover a solution (it will be really helpful if you try to deactivate all your other plugins one by one to see which one conflicts with mine... But do it only if you know what you're doing, I will not be responsible of any problem you may experience).
